        <h1 id="adult-header">How Much Activity Do Adults Need?</h1>
        <p>Focus on moving more and sitting less throughout the day. Always remember some activity is better than none. Check with your doctor before starting a physical activity routine. Adults (18-64 years) need a mix of physical activity to stay healthy. You can aim for these recommendations, but be as active as you are able:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>At least <b> 150 minutes </b> a week of moderate intensity activity such as brisk walking</li>
        <li>Or <b> 75 minutes </b> a week of vigorous intensity activity such as jogging or running</li>
        <li>Or a mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="adult-Header">Let's check the diet section for adults</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains</li>
            <li>At least <b> 400 g </b>(i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots</li>
            <li>Less than <b> 10% </b> total energy intake from free sugars which is equivalent to <b> 50 g </b>(or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits</li>
            <li>Less than <b> 30% </b> of total energy intake from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than <b> 10% </b> total energy intake and trans-fats to less than <b> 1% </b> of total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6).</li>
