Main target:

Since our site targets all ages,aged people find it easier to search through their exercises and diet required. Kids and teens find it fun to surf through our fun and exciting page just made for them. And people of middle ages find it sleek.
Our pricing involves subscription of both annually and monthly if you find our site unsatisfactory.

Some Problems we ran into:

Our grid for the pricing section was all over the place and the js was not linking,the problem was our container section we used through bootstrap which we then had to override the value of. Then came our landing page, the logo and navigation bar were a little tough to make responsive using media query(it was all over the place) since we didn't incorporate bootstrap but somehow we made it happen. Since we never did learn much about javascript this 24 hours distributing tasks made us learn about the language.
